# Stress Management System

## Description
The **Stress Management System** is a web application designed to help users track their stress levels, engage in stress-relieving activities, and record their mood. The system supports both **structured data** (numerical stress levels, activities, and moods) and **unstructured data** (text descriptions and audio recordings of stress experiences). The backend is built with **Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**, while the frontend provides a simple and user-friendly interface.

## Features
- **Structured Data**: Users can log their stress levels, activities, and moods.
- **Unstructured Data**: Users can provide descriptions and upload audio recordings.
- **Data Retrieval**: View all structured and unstructured data entries.
- **Data Management**: Update or delete stored records.
- **Audio File Handling**: Supports file uploads for stress-related recordings.
- **User Authentication**: Signup/Login for personalized stress tracking.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts for stress level trends.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ORM
- **Middleware**: CORS, Body-parser, Multer
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
